    title: WHAT IS FOREST POSITIVE PRINTING
    heading: We plant trees to counteract your printing's impact
    text_block: >-
      Forest Positive printing is extending the Forest Positive evolution into
      the print space. It allows organisations to actively contribute to more
      trees being planted than those pulped into printing paper. Forest Positive
      printing moves beyond reducing waste and transforms essential business
      printing from a negative environmental footprint to a positive force for
      reforestation and ecological renewal.
    quote: >-
      “What we are doing to the forests of the world is but a mirror reflection
      of what we are doing to ourselves and to one another.”

      Some copy here about trees, climate change, deforestation, benefits of
      planting and/or similar. It shouldn’t be too long, as we expect this
      section to not be more than this amount of lines. But there’s room for a
      bit more. Maybe another line.
