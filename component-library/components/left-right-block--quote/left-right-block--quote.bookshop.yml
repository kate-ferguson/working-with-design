    heading: We plant trees to couteract your printing's impact
    text_block: Forest Positive printing is extending the Forest Positive evolution into the print space. It allows organisations to actively contribute to more trees being planted than those pulped into printing paper. Forest Positive printing moves beyond reducing waste and transforms essential business printing from a negative environmental footprint to a positive force for reforestation and ecological renewal.
